This repo includes Selenium and Java.
# The motivation behind this repo
At my clg IIIT Sonepat 
In student's whatsAPP grp,
On BirthDay of any student,
We rename the group with his/her name,
EveryOne Wishes him.(TONS of Wishes)
I guess every BDay guy wishes to enjoy with frndz,
Never Ever in replying the whatsapp msgez.
So, I made it.

# What it exactly do?
This application will check in every 5 millisecinds: Is there any new message or not?
                                                     If yes it will check wheather it contains a birthday wish or not?
                                                     If yes reply to it by picking up a random msg from a predefined list of replies.
