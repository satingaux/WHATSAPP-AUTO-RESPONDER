# The motivation behind this repo
At my clg IIIT Sonepat <br>

# What it exactly do?
This application will check in every 5 millisecinds: Is there any new message or not?<br>
                                                     If yes it will check wheather it contains a birthday wish or not?<br>
                                                     If yes reply to it by picking up a random msg from a predefined list of replies.<br>
